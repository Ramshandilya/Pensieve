# Note Taking

* It is important to write about what you read. This is mainly because understanding requires effortful engagement and writing forces sharper understanding.

* Most note-writing practices are ephemeral and ineffective. People don't want to forget an idea or thought, so they write it down on a note. Most notes systems offer poor feedback and most “storage-oriented” notes will never be useful again.

* We should strive to design practices systems which yield compounding returns on our efforts as they accumulate over time. Evergreen note-writing helps in accumulating insights and thoughts.
