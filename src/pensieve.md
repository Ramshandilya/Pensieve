# Pensieve

Pensieve, is my personal knowledge wiki where I plan to store my thoughts, ideas and notes.

The word [Pensieve](https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/pensieve) is borrowed from the world of Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling. It's a magical object used to review memories. I'll let Albus Dumbledore explain it  - 

> I use the Pensieve. One simply siphons the excess thoughts from one's mind, pours them into the basin, and examines them at one's leisure. It becomes easier to spot patterns and links, you understand, when they are in this form.

Albeit personal knowledge, this is a public wiki and it intended to be viewed from non-participant, third-person point of view much like the Pensieve.
